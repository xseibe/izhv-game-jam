# IZHV VUT FIT Game Jam - Final Project
### Theme: Chain Reaction

**U235** is an atmospheric game taking place in the environment of a mysterious nuclear power plant, to complete the story you have to overcome 2 minigames (levels).
Please note that this is not final implementation of this game, there is still a lot of things to improve and create, to make this game more fun.

 <sub>_I am not very happy with the final form of this game. My idea was to make a puzzle game where the individual puzzles would be on the theme of Chain Reaction, but unfortunately I found out too late that this was probably not the best idea, but I didn't have time to come up with something new, so I somehow finished it._</sub>
